                    <p>In the upcoming experiment, we are investigating the effects of practicing <b>mental visualization</b> in game play. Thus, we need you to practice your mental visualization skills. We have found that the best way to do this is to have you play an online ball tossing game with other participants who are logged on at the same time.</p>
                    <p>In a few moments, you will be playing a ball tossing game with other students over our secure network. The game is very simple. <b>When the ball is tossed to you, indicate who you would like to throw the ball to using the keyboard by clicking either <u>'J'</u> (for the player to your left) or <u>'K'</u> (for the player to your right)</b>.</p>
                    <p>When it is NOT your turn to throw, you will continue mental visualization by simply <b>pressing the <u>SPACE BAR</u> to indicate that a throw has been made</b>.</p>
                    <p>These will all be labeled for you during the game.</p>

                <div id="instrp2" class="hide mt-2">
                    <p>The game will also pause at several points to help us understand how mental visualization impacts thoughts. At this time, you and the other participants will be presented a probe question regarding your thoughts at the moment the game paused. Please answer these questions honestly. <b>They will not affect your scores or progress in any way</b>.</p>
                    <p>** Please read these instructions very carefully! **</p>
                    <p>We will ask that you report your thoughts as they were <b>immediately before the presentation of the thought probe</b>.</p>
                    <p>You will see the following question appear:</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>What were you thinking about immediately before this screen? Indicate your answer using the keyboard (1, 2, or 3).</p>
                    <p>1) Thinking about the <b>mental visualization task</b> (thinking about throwing and/or following the ball).<br>
                        &emsp; - This means you are focused about the task elements; throwing the ball or pressing the space bar when the other players are throwing.
                    </p>
                    <p>2) Thinking about things related to the experiment, but not about throwing and/or following the ball (e.g., characteristics of the task and/or the other players).<br>
                        &emsp; - This means you are thinking about elements related to the game or experiment in general, but not about your actual task. Examples of this might be thinking about being bored, anxious, how much time has passed, or even thinking about what the other players are like.
                    </p>
                    <p>3) Thinking about things unrelated to the current task (e.g., thinking about anything not related to throwing and/or following the ball or the experiment itself).<br>
                        &emsp; - This means you are thinking about things other than the task/experiment. It may involve planning what you have to do later, thinking about something you are concerned about, or memories from the past. Anything other than the experiment falls in this category. This is a very common experience, so donâ€™t worry if it happens. Please be honest about your thoughts.
